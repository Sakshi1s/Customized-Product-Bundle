HTML:

It includes the necessary meta tags, title, links to external style and script files, and the content of your web page.
By linking external files, it is easier to manage and modularize code.


CSS:

It defines the appearance of the Chocolate Bundle Customizer, including the layout, colors, and fonts.


JavaScript:

It includes the calculateTotalPrice function and the calculatePrice helper function.
The calculateTotalPrice function is called when the user clicks the "Calculate Total Price" button. It retrieves the quantities of each chocolate type, validates the total number of items, calculates the total price, and updates the display.


Reasoning:

Separating styles and scripts into their respective files makes the code more readable and maintainable.
